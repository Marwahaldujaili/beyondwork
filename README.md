## Introduction

Beyond Work is a social network meant for employees in a company to interact on a personal level, create meaningful and deeper connections and share non-work related information and experiences.

Why do we need something like Beyond Work?
When thinking about the present company culture, we notice how many companies now work in a remote environment, or from different sites across the world. While this certainly has some great advantages, sometimes it can feel quite lonely and employees might miss the interpersonal relationships that are created on the workplace.

Moreover, it is scientifically proven that a more connected team makes stronger and more motivated workers.
On top of that, companies usually rely on mere chat tools for internal communication, meaning that some important information or attempts at more personal connection get lost in the hundreds of messages we receive every day.

Beyond Work, that looks and works more like a social media, is meant to fill the gap between employees and help them connect and bond.
